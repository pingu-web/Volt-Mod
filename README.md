# Volt-Mod

This is a voltage mod board for modifying gpus or motherboards. What this allows is adjusting voltage of the vcore (voltage of the core) vmem (voltage of the memory) or other various voltages that need tweaking. The board has four spots for four voltage meters and one micro usb connector to power from USB. The links for the usb connector and voltage meters are linked below.

Version 0.55! 

Re-did the layout of the board, cleaned up the wiring, and added a micro usb port.
